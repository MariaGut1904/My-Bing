# My-Bing

My-Bing is a React Native app that was created for schedule organization between me and my roommates, as well as being a reminder for tasks or homework. It's able to be shared between users. It uses Firebase for backend support and is built with modular components.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MariaGut1904/My-Bing.git
   cd My-Bing
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Add your Firebase config to `firebase.js`.

4. Run the app:

   ```
   npx react-native run-ios
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

## Structure

- `Components/` – Reusable UI elements  
- `utils/` – Helpers and Firebase setup  
- `App.js` – Main app logic
